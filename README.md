# python-challenge

This is the only thing that I could come up with for right now. 
 My issue is that I know that I need to increment a counter variable by 1 every time a row contains a candidates name, but I don't know what that looks like. We've never did it in python. We've only done something like that in VBA script. I'm not sure if I was supposed to apply that same type of formula into python.
